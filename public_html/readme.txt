How to Setup this Website

1. Create the database

Run the "PathfinderDB.sql" script found in the "SQL Scripts" folder
in your SQL server. This will create the Pathfinder database and insert 
several rows of data, including some sample data.

2. The site files

Copy and paste all the files and folders in the "public_html" folder
to your web hosting directory.

3. Setup the database connection

Open the "db_login.php" file that is found in the "php" folder with
your favourite text editor and enter in the database connection
settings for your SQL database.


AND you're done! Congratulations on setting the website up!
